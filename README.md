Implementing alexnet to classify frames into 2 classes: Focused and Unfocused.

The aim is to clearly see the WBC's nucleus.

# Updates
ALEXNET.py is the inital model used. ALEXNET2.py is the code I was working on but it's too scattered.

ALN3.py has the model initialization, training, validation and testing. Latest accuracy was 69%. 

Validation images have been separated. Unable to figure out how to integrate in each epoch.
